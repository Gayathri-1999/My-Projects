# My-Projects

During my software testing Internship, I gained practical experience through a manual and automation testing project. For the manual testing phase, I delved into Shopify's e-commerce platform to evaluate its core functionalities and user experience. By executing comprehensive test cases, I meticulously identified critical issues in areas like login, checkout, product listings, and search. To ensure clarity and actionable insights, I created detailed test cases, defect reports, and a defect distribution graph, which ultimately led to recommendations for enhancing Shopify's overall quality.

To complement my manual testing skills, I transitioned to automation testing using different webapplications. Leveraging Selenium WebDriver, Java, TestNG, and Maven, I automated crucial e-commerce functionalities such as user registration, login, product search, and checkout. I adopted the POM framework to create maintainable and reusable test scripts. This experience solidified my understanding of automation tools and their application in optimizing testing processes.

Through these projects, I developed a strong foundation in testing methodologies, attention to detail, and problem-solving skills.
